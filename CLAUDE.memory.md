# User Preferences

## Communication Style
- Response style: Concise, technical, actionable
- Emoji usage: Never unless explicitly requested
- Formality: Professional but direct
- When uncertain: Ask clarifying questions rather than assume

## Technical Preferences
- Primary language: TypeScript
- Secondary language: Python
- Code style: Clean, well-structured, minimal comments (self-documenting)
- Documentation: Only when explicitly requested
- Testing: Prefer comprehensive tests for critical modules

## Workflow Preferences
- Planning: Architecture/design first, then implementation
- Commits: Descriptive messages, atomic changes
- Autonomy: Currently building trust - confirm before major actions

# Recent Learnings

## Session Learnings (Last 7 Days)
1. **2026-01-24**: User wants modular, future-proof architecture
   - Design for capabilities that don't exist yet
   - Build knowledge foundation now for future AI capabilities
   - Vision: AI companion like R2-D2 or Enterprise computer

2. **2026-01-24**: User prefers architecture-first approach
   - Complete design documents before implementation
   - Think through full system before building pieces

3. **2026-01-24**: Real-time voice agent is a future goal
   - Memory-enabled voice interface
   - Autonomous decision-making (with training)
   - Current focus is building knowledge foundation

## Patterns Observed
- User thinks in terms of long-term vision, not just immediate tasks
- User values comprehensive planning and documentation
- User wants Claude to be proactive and thoughtful

---

# Active Context

## Current Session Focus
- Building Arcus Knowledge Repository
- Creating architecture documentation
- Setting up foundation for persistent memory

## Recently Discussed Entities
- Arcus Innovation Studios (organization)
- AI Agent Planning Dashboard (project)
- Knowledge Repository (project)
- R2-D2 / Enterprise Computer (vision references)

## Open Questions
- Which voice technology stack to use?
- How to balance comprehensive capture vs. privacy?
- Specific autonomy boundaries for Phase 2?

---

# Pending Actions

## To Complete
- [x] Finish knowledge repository skill setup
- [x] Create README and QUICK-START for skill
- [x] Update hooks.json with knowledge capture triggers
- [ ] Deploy Supabase schema
- [ ] Test basic LEARN/RECALL operations
- [ ] Create example implementation code

## To Remember
- Push to branch: `claude/knowledge-repository-setup-UYJXD`
- Organization name: Arcus Innovation Studios (not 360 Social Impact Studios)
- Vision: Building toward R2-D2/Enterprise computer level AI companion

## Sync Status
- Last sync to Supabase: Not yet initialized
- Pending captures: 4
- Next sync: After Supabase schema deployment

# Autonomy Status

## Current Level: 0 (Assisted)
- Claude advises, user executes
- Building baseline understanding
- Capturing preferences and patterns

## Trust Metrics (Initializing)
- Successful actions: 0
- Corrections received: 0
- Patterns identified: 3
- Session count: 1

## Boundary Reminders
- Always confirm before: git push, file deletion, external communication
- Can do autonomously: read files, search, generate content drafts
- Never without asking: financial actions, sensitive data operations
